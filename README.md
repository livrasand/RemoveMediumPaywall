## Usage

1. Open any article on Medium that has a member content barrier (_"Members-only story"_).
2. If the article has this barrier, right-click its button to display a custom context menu.

3. Select "Aplicar RMP a este artículo".
4. Once the page reloads, **Remove Medium Paywall** will automatically detect the content barrier and request its removal. If this does not work, then from the context menu select "Agregar dominio a RMP".
5. Repeat step 3.
6. Wait a few seconds while **Remove Medium Paywall** loads the full article content.
7. After a few seconds, the full article content should appear without the membership paywall.
8. Verify that the script worked correctly by checking if the article content is now fully visible and accessible.
9. If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please **[create an issue](https://github.com/livrasand/RemoveMediumPaywall/issues)** in the original project repository.
10. Provide details about the problem found so it can be corrected quickly.

### Enjoy reading without barriers on Medium!
