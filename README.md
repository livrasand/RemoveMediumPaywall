The intrusive "The writer made this a members-only story" message is annoying. This open-source project aims to address this issue by providing a solution to bypass all “Members-only story” paywalls for Medium articles. This repository contains a userscript designed to remove the annoying "The writer made this a members-only story". Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Usage

1. Open any article on Medium that has a member content barrier (_"Members-only story"_).
2. If the article has this barrier, please reload the page.
3. Once the page is reloaded, **Remove Medium Paywall** will automatically detect the content barrier and make the request to remove it.
4. Wait a few seconds while **Remove Medium Paywall** loads the full article content.
5. After a few seconds, the full article content should appear without the membership paywall.
6. Verify that the script worked correctly by checking if the article content is now fully visible and accessible.
7. If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please **[create an issue](https://github.com/livrasand/RemoveMediumPaywall/issues)** in the original project repository.
8. Provide details about the problem found so it can be corrected quickly.

### Enjoy reading without barriers on Medium!
